# javascript-space-cadets
A simple Javascript game designed to teach programming to young space cadets. The game is intended to provide the opportunity to implement game features one by one within an extant framework, with the support of somebody with some programming skills, who may explain syntax and introduce concepts as necessary.

The project is split into two parts: outset and solution. The outset is the starting point for anyone beginning this journey. Following the steps outlined below, in sequence, will let you evolve that starting point into something resembling an actual game. The solution represents the end state, and is available as a support should you get stuck. Or simply to play around with.

# Steps

## Step 0
Explore the outset directly. For now it is enough to understand that there is an HTML and a CSS file, that the images and sounds directories contain images and sounds, and that scripts is where all the action is.
